of tools used in open source intelligence gathering, and
reconnaissance. Functionality to install any dependencies needed
by the tools in question is included in this script in order to
facilitate quick and easy deployment.

Below is an overview of the options available to you.

The 'help' option displays this informational message. The 'List and Install'
option shows you a list of tools available to download and install with
IntRec-Pack. The 'Install All' options automatically downloads and installs
every utility that is featured in this script including their individual
dependencies respectively. 'Specify Install Location' allows you to input
a path to a directory to which you'd like the utilities saved to. The default
location is the current working directory.

The 'Online Resources' option employs the Mozilla Geckodriver in order to load
two web based OSINT resource aggregators and an OSINT Threat Intel service as well.
The first entry under this category is 'osintframework.com' which serves as a 
curated list of OSINT oriented web services, documentation, and provides a catalog
of utilities and assorted programs to help customize and expand your intel gathering
environment and OSINT toolkit in general. 

The second item under 'Online Resources' loads 'toddignton.com/resources'. 
This website serves as an additional knowledge hub, which can be used as a
comprehensive reference guide geared towards tooling, techniques, and documentation.
 
The third and final item under this category is HoneyDB which is an OSINT based threat
intelligence aggregator. HoneyPy honeypots provide the data accesible here and the 
HoneyDB web application provides a data visualization service and Thread Feed 
functionality as well.
